    <h1>Under construction</h1>
    <p>This will be the place where I will log and detail the projects that I work on. <br>
        The aim of this web dev project is to learn HTML, CSS and GO while building a place where I can store my thoughts
        and discoveries for all my past and future projects.</p>
