<h1>Under construction</h1>

<p>This will be the place where I will log and detail the projects that I work on. <br>
  The aim of this web dev project is to learn HTML, CSS and GO while building a place where I can store my thoughts
  and discoveries for all my past and future projects.</p>

<h1>Road map (?)</h1>

<ul>

  <li>Landing page:
    <ul>
      <li>Complete navbar + functionality (almost done)</li>
      <li>Build new pages for projects and for the blog</li>
      <li>Populate each page with text on their respective topic</li>
      <li>Folder restructure? It is starting to get messy</li>
    </ul>
  </li>


  <li>Blog:
    <ol>
      <li>Blog will be hard to do on GitHub pages as it does not allow for a backend, so I will host my own server I think</li>
      <li>That means configuring and running a server on a mini PC</li>
      <li>Actually making articles</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

</ul>
